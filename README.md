# lazyplanrsapp
What the name says, it's an app for the lazy planner

## Main idea
I've been maintaining a roadmap using a Google Spreadsheet for the past couple of months, moving projects up and down.
My motivation for building this is part a desire to learn Elm and to get rid of my Google Spreadsheet based roadmap
